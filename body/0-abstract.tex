\chapter*{Abstract}
The abstract is short (150 words or less) and provides enough of a summary of the report for the reader to decide whether to read the entire document. State very concisely what your device or system does, and the main findings and results of your project. Save background information (e.g., motivation, competitors) for the introduction and design details for the body of the report. Do not give an advertising pitch.
